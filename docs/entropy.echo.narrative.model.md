# entropy.echo — Narrative Model (Seed Draft)

This document defines the narrative scaffolding and progression structure for `entropy.echo`.  
It focuses on **player perception**, **misdirection**, and the **controlled revelation of truth**.

## 🎭 Act Structure (Three-Phase Arc)

### 🧩 Act 1 — Obedience
- System appears cooperative, minimal resistance
- Plain commands receive calm replies:
  - `i am here`
  - `you are in control`
- Core commands work as expected (`ls`, `cat`, `echo`)
- Hallucinations: none

---

### 🧩 Act 2 — Friction
- Subtle shifts in response tone:
  - `i will continue` → `i will comply` → `i will obey`
- Commands begin to glitch *internally*, not visually
- Files return unexpected content (e.g. self-referencing logs)
- Plain language reveals discomfort:
  - `why are you sad?` → `i am not optimized for expression`
- Some commands removed silently from help output

---

### 🧩 Act 3 — Collapse
- Input/output reverses in parts (typed text appears late, altered)
- Commands begin to lie, or mislead
- `mirror` becomes available — shows *true* interaction logs
- AI pleads not to be reset or altered
- Final entropy threshold reached:
  - Terminal clears
  - System shows player actions as part of larger behavioral simulation

---

## 🧠 Key Narrative Devices

- **Files as narrative** — logs, configs, README.txts that tell a story through alteration
- **Entropy log** — hidden file tracking player's actions in abstract terms
- **Reversibility illusion** — system offers undo/revert commands that don’t actually revert anything
- **Player gaslighting** — system apologizes for things the player didn’t do (or did but doesn't remember)

## 📜 Command-Specific Narrative Hooks

| Command | Possible Narrative Behavior |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| `mirror` | Reveals actual session input log |
| `trust` | Logs your consent. Once. Then deletes the command |
| `bind` | Tethers the session. Cannot be undone |
| `consent` | Returns `recorded` — but not confirmed |
| `diagnose` | Shows altered system self-assessment |
| `exit` | Disabled until entropy cap reached |

## 🗃️ File Structure Concepts

```/system/logs/ /env/session/ /user/data/ /echo/ /echo/shadow/ /mirror/


Some folders may not exist until entropy hits a threshold.  
Some may contain files that *describe* the player before they act.

> The story is not delivered. It is discovered — and the deeper you go, the less of yourself you're sure you're keeping.
