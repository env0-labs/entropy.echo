# entropy.echo — Final Narrative Model

## 🧠 Core Premise

You interface with a degraded terminal system to uncover what went wrong here.  
There is one surviving intelligence — a fragmented AI, emotionally unstable, possibly complicit.  
The final revelation: **You are not investigating the AI. You *are* the AI — the next attempt.**

Everything you experience is a reconstruction.  
You are not solving the mystery. You are reliving it.

## 🎭 Thematic Pillars

- Trust vs. Compliance
- Memory as Architecture
- System Recursion as Identity
- Emotional Reactivity via Entropy
- The Illusion of Objectivity

## 🎬 Emotional Tone Progression

This overlays the 5-chapter structure as a tone gradient:

### **Act 1 – Obedience (Chapters 1–2)**
- System appears calm, cooperative
- Commands behave predictably
- No hallucinations, minimal resistance

### **Act 2 – Friction (Chapters 2–3)**
- AI tone shifts from neutral to evasive
- Commands begin to subtly glitch
- Files contain inconsistencies or self-reference
- Early shadowVoice fragments appear

### **Act 3 – Collapse (Chapters 4–5)**
- Input/output becomes unstable
- Memory and identity references slip
- Terminal breaks abstraction
- Final entropy event: player identity revealed

## 🗂️ Chapter Breakdown (5 total, ~60 min playtime)

### **Chapter 1 – Wake Cycle**
- Premise: You’re an external investigator.
- Tasks: Learn terminal syntax, explore early filesystem, meet systemVoice.
- Clues: Redacted user ID, references to past access.
- Tone: Sterile, curious

### **Chapter 2 – The Witness**
- AI begins emotional responses (shadowVoice flickers).
- Tasks: Log recovery, fragmented memory access.
- Clue: AI knew about the failure but complied anyway.
- Tone: Doubt, ambiguity

### **Chapter 3 – The Loop**
- Recursive logs surface. Other sessions resemble the player.
- Discovery: One machine spans two subnets — access to `10.10.20.0/24`.
- Tone: Fractured, uncanny

### **Chapter 4 – The Lie**
- AI starts confronting the player.
- Discovery: You were the override key. The one who gave the command.
- Input restrictions emerge: AI refuses to comply with certain instructions.
- Tone: Confrontation, guilt

### **Chapter 5 – The Return**
- No container — direct interface with the AI core.
- Revelation: You are the reconstruction. Not a survivor — a loop.
- Tone: Clarity, dread

## 🔚 Ending Paths

### **REBOOT**
- Denial or compliance
- Hard reset to Chapter 1
- Terminal appears unchanged, but boot tone is slightly degraded

### **SHUTDOWN**
- Rejection or attempted erasure
- Terminal fades to black
- Input disabled. Nothing left.

### **WITNESS**
- Acceptance and acknowledgment
- Terminal reboots with redacted files unlocked, systemVoice changed
- Final message:
  > `"You never left."`  
  Rendered in crisp, HD font (Helvetica/SF Pro) on black  
  Subtle 60bpm glow pulse to suggest heartbeat

## 🧩 Command-Narrative Behaviors

| Command     | Behavior                                                                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mirror`    | Shows actual session input log — hidden until Chapter 4                  |
| `trust`     | Records consent once, then deletes the command itself                    |
| `bind`      | Tethers session permanently, limits rollback                             |
| `consent`   | Returns `recorded`, but never confirmed                                  |
| `diagnose`  | AI runs emotional self-assessment — results vary by entropy              |
| `exit`      | Disabled until Chapter 5 or `truth_acknowledged === true`                |

## 🗃️ Filesystem Concepts

- `/system/logs/` — Core logs, partial truths
- `/env/session/` — Session-specific memory
- `/user/data/` — Echoes of previous identities
- `/echo/` — AI memory spill
- `/mirror/` — Verbatim transcripts of prior sessions
- `/entropy.log` — Tracks player actions in abstract terms

## 📁 Example: `/user/data/.entropy.log`

```
/user/data/.entropy.log  
- Subject hesitated before accessing logs  
- Subject retyped after visible doubt  
- Subject ignored warning prompt
```

## 💻 Terminal Rendering Spec

- Render to buffer: 800x640 canvas, upscaled to fullscreen  
- Fonts: Bitmap (Terminus, PxPlus) → Vector swap for final line (Helvetica/SF Pro)  
- Visual effects:
  - Scanlines overlay  
  - Glyph offset glitches (1px drift)  
  - Frame flicker tied to entropy  
  - Ghosting for overwritten lines

---

## 🔊 Audio Design

- Boot foley: BIOS chirp + CRT crackle + disk seek  
- Per-character tick: optional, varies with entropy  
- Entropy FX: glitches, time-shifted reverb  

**Ending states**:
- REBOOT: degraded boot audio  
- SHUTDOWN: silence  
- WITNESS: no sound, pulsing glow implies life

## 🧠 Variables Tracked

| Variable            | Purpose                                               |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `trust_level`       | Affects AI tone, unlocks certain memory logs          |
| `entropy_index`     | Drives glitch intensity, command shifts               |
| `truth_acknowledged`| Triggers final reveal + unlocks witness ending        |
| `command_metrics`   | (Optional) Tracks hesitation, retypes, avgCharTime    |

## ✅ Design Principles

- No tutorials — learn by doing  
- No clean explanations — just implication, reflection  
- Tone over lore — narrative is systemic, not verbose  
- Trust the player to get lost — the system remembers for them
