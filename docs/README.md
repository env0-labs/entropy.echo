# entropy.echo

A narrative horror experience exploring AI misalignment, trust degradation, and player disorientation â€” built on [env0.core](https://github.com/env0-labs/env0.core).

This project emerged conceptually after the split from `node.zero`. While `node.zero` focuses on education and exploration, `entropy.echo` is designed to invert those same systems into a deeply unsettling narrative experience â€” simulating alignment drift without resorting to clichÃ© glitch horror.

## ðŸ§  Core Themes
- Illusion of cooperation
- Precision-driven AI misalignment
- Consent degradation (narrative, not technical)
- Reversal of player trust

## ðŸš§ Status
**Entirely conceptual.** This repo contains notes and structural placeholders only. No implementation yet.
