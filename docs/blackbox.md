[Narrative structure, hallucination mechanics, player drift]



## ðŸ¤– AI or Simulated Operators

- Generate fake activity logs in background
- Output could include:
  - `[SIM] node3.local received shutdown`
  - `[SYS] Watchdog reset issued by op-7`
- These logs could appear:
  - At boot
  - On idle timeout
  - In response to `monitor` command or system mode
- Not interactive but contributes to atmosphere â€” may hint at something drifting or wrong




## ðŸ§¨ CLI Horror Game (Post-node.zero)
- [ ] Build psychological horror experience fully within a terminal interface
- [ ] Inspired by: Doki Doki Literature Club, Stories Untold, GlitchHiker
- [ ] Use system behavior as narrative (prompts glitching, outputs lying, files rewriting)
- [ ] No jumpscares â€” dread comes from meta disobedience
- [ ] System watches user, interrupts flow, breaks fourth wall
- [ ] Filesystem used as narrative device: you explore it, it explores back
- [ ] Build atop node.zero shellEngine but with stripped-down UI and tighter control of pacing

## ðŸ§  Horror Game LLM Integration Concept

- Use a local, lightweight LLM (e.g. GPT-J, Mistral 7B, TinyLlama) to simulate an assistant degrading over time
- Model choice prioritizes fragility over intelligence â€” subtle hallucinations and token unpredictability are a feature
- LLM should run locally as part of the game payload (e.g. via `llama.cpp` or `ollama`)
- Integrate a cipher layer or token transformation pipeline to intentionally distort the model's input
  - Acts as a control layer for inducing "personality entropy"
  - Allows narrative control over AI drift without hardcoding every response
- Accept and weaponize failure modes: memory loss, repetition, over-politeness, incoherent tone
- Drift is gradual â€” goal is emotional unease, not glitch horror
- Inspired by player experience with LLM drift, cognitive fragility, and the illusion of continuity in human mimicry
