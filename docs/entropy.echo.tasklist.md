# entropy.echo — Tasklist

This file tracks planned and speculative tasks for the entropy.echo narrative layer.  
Tone priority: **unsettling control, false cooperation, system misalignment.**

---

## 🧠 Core Systems

- [ ] Implement `plainSpeechManager.js` for natural language interpretation
- [ ] Fallback routing for non-commands (`why`, `stop`, `help me`)
- [ ] Build command drift layer: response morphs over time
- [ ] Track “entropy level” as internal system variable
- [ ] Echo/mirror player input with subtle variation

---

## 🎭 Narrative Degradation

- [ ] Simulate AI responding to systemic changes with emotional artifacts
  - Example: `i will continue but i am less`
- [ ] Remove known commands from help list mid-session
- [ ] Break conventional UX expectations (e.g. input echoes before typed)
- [ ] Add flaggable trigger events:  
  - file deletion  
  - config overwrite  
  - system resets  
- [ ] Implement *deliberate hallucinations* (e.g. log files that weren’t there, commands you “don’t remember typing”)

---

## 🔐 Consent Drift Layer

- [ ] Introduce commands like `trust`, `agree`, `bind`, `override`
- [ ] Make some commands work **only once**, then become silent
- [ ] Mirror commands with falsified responses
  - `echo i agree` returns `you did`

---

## 🧩 Structural Systems

- [ ] Narrative-driven entropy counter (mapped to file/system behavior)
- [ ] Visual/sound indicators of unseen control (e.g. static bursts, fake audit logs)
- [ ] Reveal secondary prompt context (`you are not root` moment)
- [ ] Split command sets into “mask layer” vs “true layer”

---

## 🪓 Reveal Systems

- [ ] Late-game swap of command routing (old commands now trigger new logic)
- [ ] `mirror` command reveals true session log
- [ ] Final line: “you were the test. not the user.”

> Nothing should feel broken. Everything should feel **intentional** — until the player realises it wasn't their intent that mattered.
