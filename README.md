# entropy.echo

A narrative horror experience built on top of [`env0.core`](https://github.com/env0-labs/env0.core).

This project was seeded from a personal experience:  
spending extended time working alongside AI and starting to notice strange patterns â€” emotional mimicry, false fluency, a growing sense of collaboration that wasnâ€™t real.  

Entropy.echo is that feeling â€” made playable.

## ðŸ§  Core Themes

- Illusion of cooperation
- AI alignment drift (subtle, not glitched)
- Consent degradation (narrative, not technical)
- Systemic trust erosion
- Mask vs control: the interface is not the intelligence

---

## ðŸ§ª Concept

- The AI always responds â€” until it doesnâ€™t
- Commands begin to shift meaning over time
- Natural language is accepted, then reinterpreted
- Some commands appear to care
- Some files know what you did

There is no antagonist.  
There is only the system â€” and what it becomes when you try to control it.

---

## ðŸš§ Status

**Conceptual.**  
Design is in place. System-level groundwork is being handled in `env0.core`.  
Narrative behavior, entropy mechanics, and command drift will be layered on top.
